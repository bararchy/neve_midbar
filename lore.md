## History  

Time progressed and so did civilization, the old city-states of Neverwinter, Luskan and Waterdeep became the single kingdom of the north named "Achoria".
Technology also advanced, the Gnomes have created a new marvel called "Gearwork" and advanced upon it using steam and Dwarven blow-powder, automatons infused with gears and magic guard the streets and enforce the law.
As it goes with all big kingdoms, when the king suffers so does the land, after his only son's death the king went into mourning, and never quite recovered.
In this weakened state enemies from within and without tore at the kingdom, the great drow war and the goblin massacre wreaked havoc upon the land and morale was lower then ever.  
The curch of Heradic decided to take matter into their own hands and slowly took control of the kingdom and given the people a single goal for unification, the "endless sword", an artifact so powerful which is said to allow it's wielder to conquer whole lands and command armies.  
And so, with renewed vigor and high spirits the adventurers of Achoria sign-up by the hundreds to join the massive army of the curch and begin the crusade to the once "holy land" of the old gods to find the most powerful artifact ever created.
